This is my Advent of Code 2021 folder! I'm running it a little bit different from my past ones, because I just discovered that I can use C# in Jupyter Notebooks! I want to see what I can do with it, with a goal of getting a little bit more flashy and explainy than I have been before. Maybe I'll also provide charts and graphs and stuff as practice for Plotly, who knows.

You're free to use the code I write here for learning purposes, but please don't pass it off as your own. I'd appreciate a heads-up if you're reusing it, mostly so I can see in what. Other than that, enjoy the show!

(PS: I'm publishing this in April 2024, which is the actual time I wrote this stuff. I haven't done AoC2021 before, but I've done parts of 19, 22, and 23.)
